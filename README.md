#### Tools and Techniques Used

- **HTML5 & Semantic Markup**  
  Utilized semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`) to structure content clearly and improve accessibility.

- **CSS3 with Modern Features**  
  Leveraged CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible and responsive layouts, CSS variables for consistent theming, and `clamp()` for fluid typography scaling across devices.

- **Accessibility Best Practices**  
  Implemented ARIA roles and attributes, keyboard-focus-visible styles, and descriptive labels to enhance usability for screen readers and keyboard users.

- **External Libraries**  
  Integrated Google Material Icons and FontAwesome for intuitive iconography, enhancing visual cues without additional image assets.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Developed mobile-first responsive layouts with media queries to ensure an optimized experience on all screen sizes and devices.

- **Performance and Security**  
  Adopted defer loading for external scripts and proper iframe attributes (`loading="lazy"`, `referrerpolicy`) to improve loading speed and security.

#### Challenges Faced and Improvements Made

- **Responsive Navigation Menu**  
  Initially, the dropdown menu behaved inconsistently on smaller screens. Through iterative testing, the structure and styles were refined to support both hover and keyboard navigation, with visual focus indicators and better mobile usability.

- **Consistent Theming and Spacing**  
  Balancing color contrast and spacing to meet accessibility standards while maintaining a modern aesthetic required multiple revisions. Introducing CSS variables made managing theme colors and radii easier across components.

- **Form Usability and Validation**  
  Refining form controls for clarity, focus feedback, and semantic correctness was essential to ensure a frictionless user experience. Added `autocomplete` attributes and `novalidate` to handle validation elegantly.

- **Layout Flexibility**  
  Transitioning from fixed flexbox widths to responsive CSS Grid enabled adaptable columns that gracefully rearranged on different device widths, improving content readability and preventing layout breakage.

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  Avoided blocking resources and unnecessary styles by adopting modern CSS techniques and deferring external JS scripts. This resulted in faster load times and smoother interactions.

#### Design and Development Decisions

- **Mobile-First and Accessibility Focus**  
  Prioritized mobile usability and made accessibility a central consideration to deliver an inclusive experience for all users.

- **Semantic and Clean Markup**  
  Chose semantic tags and accessible ARIA attributes to improve SEO and usability with assistive technologies.

- **Modern CSS Techniques**  
  Employed CSS Grid, Flexbox, and variables for maintainable, scalable, and clean styling.

- **Use of Icon Libraries**  
  Selected Material Icons and FontAwesome to enrich the UI while minimizing asset weight and maintenance.

- **Iterative Enhancements**  
  Multiple development cycles led to refinements in responsiveness, interaction design, and code efficiency, culminating in a polished, production-ready final submission.
