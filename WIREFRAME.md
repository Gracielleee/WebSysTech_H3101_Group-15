# WebSysTech_H3101_Group-15: Wireframe Documentation

This low-fidelity wireframes represent five core sections of a restaurant & hotel booking system: **Booking, Suites, Dining, Experience, and Access**. The goal was to create a clean, intuitive, and visually consistent interface that supports user goals with minimal friction.

### Alignment with HCI Principles

#### **Consistency & Standards**

- Uniform layout across all screens (e.g., title placement, “Book Now” button) ensures users don’t need to relearn navigation.
- Red accent color for CTAs (Call-to-Action) maintains visual consistency and reinforces affordance.

#### **Recognition Over Recall**

- Each screen uses clear labels (“SUITES,” “DINING,” etc.) and visual cues (images of rooms, meals, activities) to reduce cognitive load.
- Dropdowns and buttons are labeled intuitively, allowing users to recognize options without memorizing steps.

#### **Visibility of System Status**

- The “Booking...” screen provides feedback that the reservation process is underway, keeping users informed.

#### **User Control & Freedom**

- Each section includes a “Book Now” button, giving users control to initiate actions from any point in the app.

#### **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**

- The black-and-white theme with red highlights creates a modern, uncluttered look.
- Content is prioritized over decoration, focusing on essential information and actions.

#### **Flexibility & Efficiency of Use**

- Dropdowns and modular sections (e.g., suite selection, dining options) allow for quick decision-making and personalization.

### Technical Considerations & Development Challenges

#### **Responsive Design**

- Ensuring the layout adapts well across various screen sizes and resolutions will be critical, especially for image-heavy sections.

#### **Image Optimization**

- High-quality visuals for suites, dining, and experiences must be optimized for fast loading without compromising aesthetics.

#### **Navigation Architecture**

- Implementing smooth transitions between sections (e.g., from Dining to Booking) will require thoughtful routing and state management.

#### **Accessibility (recommendation for future & advance development)**

- Color contrast (red on black/white) must be tested for accessibility compliance (WCAG standards).
- Interactive elements like dropdowns and buttons should be keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly.

#### **Backend Integration (recommendation for future & advance development)**

- Real-time availability, booking logic, and user data management will require robust API integration and secure data handling.
